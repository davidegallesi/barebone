It’s that time of year when I ponder the planner setup for the year to come.

I’m a long time Hobonichi user, I started with the Techo and in the last few years I have always used the [Hobonichi Weeks](https://tigro.neocities.org/2023/11/20/planner-setup-2024s).

But for 2025 I’m toying with the idea to go for a simple plain notebook with good fountain pen friendly paper, like Tomoe River or MD paper.

No templates, no frameworks, no constrains; just a blank sheet.

A blank clean sheet is always a good starting point.
